                    <p><a target = "_blank" href = "https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_ponies">Earth ponies</a>
                    possess a diverse range of talents and capabilities. One recurring trait, however, is
                    their physical prowess. Physically very powerful, some Earth ponies are capable of
                    performing incredible feats of strength with little or no visible strain and enjoying
                    long-lasting stamina as well.</p>

                    demonstrate great speed and agility in the air. They can walk, sit, and lie on
                    clouds, while the other ponies need magic in order to do so. Their wings are strong and
                    prehensile, as they can use them as extra limbs to perform tasks that only winged
                    creatures can do. </p>

                    <p><a target = "_blank" href = "https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Unicorns">Unicorns</a> 
                    have a long horn protruding from their forehead which glows when their magical powers
                    are used. When unicorns cast magic, it produces a colored aura around their horns and
                    any objects their magic affects. The color of the glow is different among individuals,
                    usually matching the color of their eyes or a prominent color of their cutie mark.</p>

                    <p><a target = "_blank" href = "http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Alicorns">Alicorns</a> are ponies
                    with a larger body than most other pony races in Equestria. They have the
                    strength of an earth pony, the wings of a pegasus, and the magic of a unicorn. They are far
                    stronger, can fly faster, and can cast more powerful spells than other ponies. They are the
                    rulers of Equestria and can usually live for a very long period of time. </p>

                in Equestria resemble classical European dragons, with large bodies, long necks 
                and tails, scales, and bat-like wings. They love to eat gems and can breathe fire. 
                Dragons come in various shapes and sizes. Some of them are short and are only two to
                three times the height of an average pony, while others are large and towers over most
                creatures in Equestria.</p>

                resemble the griffons in classical fantasy tales. Their front half resembles an eagle,
                while the back half resembles a lion. Griffons are depicted as greedy creatures
                whose lust for gold and treasure is stated to rival that of dragons, and they only offer 
                their services in exchange for bits. Only a few of them are kind towards others. 
                </p>
                <p>Griffons reside in <a target = "_blank" href = "http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Griffonstone">
                Griffonstone</a>, which used to be a great a majestic kingdom under the rule of
                <a target = "_blank" href = "https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_non-pony_characters#King_Grover">
                King Grover</a>. However, the city became a small, shabby-looking town when the
                griffon's treasure was stolen away by a monster. The griffons returned to their selfish
                ways upon the decline of their kingdom.</p>

                <p><a target = "_blank" href = "https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Changelings">Changelings</a> are a
                race of creatures that are equine in appearance but possess insect-like characteristics.
                They first appeared as creatures with black carapace-like fur-less exteriors, webbed manes
                and tails, blue reflection-less eyes, fangs, bent horns, jagged ears, insect-like wings,
                and holes in their legs. Following the metamorphosis they have underwent in the season 6
                finale, they now have varied coat colors and insect characteristics, and they no longer have
                fangs or holes in their bodies. They also have more physical differences among them: some
                possess longer, more jagged horns, and others no longer have horns at all. Some also have
                a trio of gemstone-like objects in their chests.</p>

                Yaks</a> are large, powerful bovine creatures with large horns and are covered with thick fur
                and mane all over their bodies. They are known for their strength and often smash objects to
                display their power towards other creatures, especially during the holiday Yickslurbertfest.
                They live in <a target = "_blank" href = "https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Locations#Yakyakistan">

                are creatures that are a cross between a pony and an eagle. They reside in the Kingdom of
                Hippogriffia, made up of a small cluster of dormant volcanic islands situated far to
                the south of Equestria. Mount Aris is the heart of the Kingdom of Hippogriffia, completely
                dominating the surrounding area due to its incredible height. The mountainâ€™s peak extends
                far up into the clouds, perpetually shrouding it in a thin veil of fog. While there have
                been no objective measurements, Aris is believed to be the tallest mountain south of the
                Equestrian border.</p>

                are pony-like creatures that have scales covering their back and the middle of their heads.
                They have large, curved horns on their foreheads, which they use to cast spells. They
                have cloven hooves, leonine tails, and a large, dorsal mane covering the side of their
                heads. Their furs, manes, horns, and scales are colorful, just like the ponies in
                Equestria. Kirins also have the ability to turn into niriks when they become angry. Niriks
                have black fur and have flames sprouting around their heads, tail, and feet. Their eyes
                become completely white, and they have fangs in their mouths.</p>
                <p>Kirins live in Peaks of Peril, a remote mountain range covered with grass, trees, and other
                lush plants. </p>
